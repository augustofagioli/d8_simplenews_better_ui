 8. MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT

    Simplenews supports multilingual newsletters for node translation and url
    path prefixes.

    ** Who wants to receive newsltter in random languages? That would be so confusing **


    When translated newsletter issues are available subscribers receive the
    newsletter in their preferred language (according to account setting).
    Translation module is required for newsletter translation.

    Path prefixes are added to footer message according to the subscribers
    preferred language.

    The preferred language of anonymous users is set based on the interface
    language of the page they visit for subscription. Anonymous users can NOT
    change their preferred language. Users with an account on the site will be
    subscribed with the preferred language as set in their account settings.

    The confirmation mails can be translated by enableding the Simplenews
    variables at:
      Home > Administration > Configuration > Regional and language > Multilingual settings > Variables
    Afterwards, the mail subject and body can be entered for every enabled
    language.
